##Transmogrifier

Drag and drop audio files into the interface and it will transcode them into 128k, 96k and 64k aac files and then segment those versions and create a variant playlist for http live streaming.

##Requires

Apples HTTP Live Streaming tools to do segmenting and variant playlist creation.

##Other

The HTTPLSTransmogrifier and AACTranscoder classes might be useful their own. They're untested on iOS, but I'd expect they'd work fine.
